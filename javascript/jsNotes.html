<!-- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.
This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced. -->

<!-- Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages -->

  <!--  Did You Know?
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language -->


<!--/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  -->

<!-- <script> Tag:-
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags. -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	//body
</script>

<!-- JavaScript Display Possibilities:-
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
 -->

<!-- Using console.log()
For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.
 -->
<script>
console.log("welcome");
</script>

<!-- Using document.write()
For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write():
 -->
<script>
document.write("<h1>My First Web Page</h1>");
</script>

<!-- Note:Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML: -->

<!-- JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.
Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Keyword	    Description
var	        Declares a variable
let	        Declares a block variable
const	        Declares a block constant
if	           Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch	     Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for	        Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function	     Declares a function
return	     Exits a function
try	        Implements error handling to a block of statements

Note:-JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
 -->


JavaScript Variables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

<script type="text/javascript">
	let x;//var x;//const x;  //three ways to variable declaration
    x = 6;
</script>



<!-- 
JavaScript Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed: -->

<!-- JavaScript Identifiers / Names
Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Note
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
 -->

 JavaScript is Case Sensitive
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:
<script type="text/javascript">
let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
</script>


<!-- JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:
first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.


 -->
<!-- 
 JavaScript Comments

javaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript. -->



JavaScript Variables
<!-- 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing
What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
 -->
<script type="text/javascript">
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
</script>

<!-- Value = undefined
In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
 -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	let carName;
</script>

<!-- When to Use JavaScript var?
Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
If you think the value of the variable can change, use let. -->


<!-- JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. -->

<script type="text/javascript">
	const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';

</script>
